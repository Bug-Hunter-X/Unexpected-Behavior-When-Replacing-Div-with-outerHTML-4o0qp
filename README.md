# Uncommon HTML Error: Unexpected Behavior When Replacing Div with outerHTML

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML that can occur when using the `outerHTML` property to replace a div element.

The `outerHTML` property replaces the entire element, including its contents and any associated event listeners or script dependencies. This can lead to unexpected behavior if other parts of your script rely on that element being present in the DOM.

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.html` provides a solution using innerHTML or DOM manipulation instead.

## Bug Description
The issue arises when we replace a div element using its `outerHTML`.  This removes the div from the DOM, potentially breaking functionality depending on other parts of the script.

## Solution
The solution avoids using `outerHTML` and instead leverages `innerHTML` or a more controlled DOM manipulation approach. This maintains the expected DOM structure and avoids disrupting script dependencies.
